# Touchwheels

Some capacitive sense rotary touchwheels.  

These work by using only three capactive touch pads in a specific interleaved 
geometry and measuring the ratio analog capacitive touch between the pads to 
compute a distance along the slider. 


### Touchwheels made so far: 

* touchwheel0 - [available on Tindie as a kit!](https://www.tindie.com/products/todbot/touchwheel0-capacitive-touch-wheel/)

### What's in Tindie touchwheel0 kit: 

One way to play with these touchwheels is to [get the Tindie kit](https://www.tindie.com/products/todbot/touchwheel0-capacitive-touch-wheel/), which comes with:

- touchwheel0 black PCB
- 4 x 1M 0805 SMD resistors (only three needed, one is a spare)
- 1 x 4-pin pin header
